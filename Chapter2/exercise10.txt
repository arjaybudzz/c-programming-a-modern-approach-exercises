In the dweight.c program (Section 2.4), which spaces are essential?

ANSWER:

dweight.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int height, length, width, volume, weight;
	printf("Enter height of box: ");
	scanf("%d", &height);
	printf("Enter length of box: ");
	scanf("%d", &length);
	printf("Enter width of box: ");
	scanf("%d", &width);
	volume = height * length * width;
	weight = (volume + 165) / 166;
	printf("Volume (cubic inches): %d\n", volume);
	printf("Dimensional weight (pounds): %d\n", weight);
	return 0;
}

The spaces that are essential are:

1. space between int and main token.
2. space between int and height variable.
3. space between return and 0 token.

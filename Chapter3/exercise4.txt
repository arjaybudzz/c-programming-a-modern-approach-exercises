Suppose that we call scanf as follows:

	scanf("%d%f%d", &i, &x, &j);

If the user enters

	10.3 5 6

what will be the values of i, x, and j after the call? (Assume that i and j are int variables
and x is a float variable.)

ANSWER:

The value of i will be 10 because since the variable is type int, the decimal point will be left since an int
does not have decimal point. Now, for the value of x, the value will be 0.3 because the decimal point will be
the first character that will be read by scanf and the variable is type float, it will be assigned to variable x
and will continue to read until the whitespace character is read. Now, The next one is 5 and it will be put to
the value of j and therefore, 6 will be left for the next call to scanf.

i = 10, x = 0.3, j = 5

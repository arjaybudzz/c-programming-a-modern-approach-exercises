/*
	Write a program that asks the user to enter the numbers from 1 to 16 (in any order) and then
	displays the numbers in a 4 by 4 arrangement, followed by the sums of the rows, columns,
	and diagonals:

	Enter the numbers from 1 to 16 in any order:
	16 3 2 13 5 10 11 8 9 6 7 12 4 15 14 1

	16 3 2 13
	5 10 11 8
	9 6 7 12
	4 15 14 1

	Row sums: 34 34 34 34
	Column sums: 34 34 34 34
	Diagonal sums: 34 34

	If the row, column, and diagonal sums are all the same (as they are in this example), the
	numbers are said to form a magic square. The magic square shown here appears in a 1514
	engraving by artist and mathematician Albrecht DÃ¼rer. (Note that the middle numbers in the
	last row give the date of the engraving.)
